# checking based on reports from AV

ok great - I think we are almost there - we should just double verify the situation  - was it a scan labeling issue or something else, as ICVs from scan 1 to scan 2 are identical for each participant (i.e. 210030 has consistent ICVs and 320032 has consistent ICVs)

#### 320032

- [] xnat uploads are distinct
- [] qc native views look different
- [X] longitudinal uses two files


#### 210020

- [X] xnat uploads are distinct 08/2014 vs 09/2014
- [X] qc native views look different
- [X] lontigutinal feed two files..

## Note October 2018: we did get a new upload of 210030's baseline scan this fixed the issue
